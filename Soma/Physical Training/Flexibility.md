Flexibility is the body’s available range of motion.

[[Mobility]] is the range of motion that can be accessed without external assistance. 

# Current Approach
ROM must be split into multiple chains. I currently train:
	[[Pike]] (posterior chain)
	[[Bridge]] (anterior chain)
	[[Middle Split]] (medial chain)
	

I also recently have been prioritizing [[Torso Rotation ROM]] and [[Upper Body ROM]]

There are some “physical therapists” and YouTube gurus that claim that static stretching isn’t effective and even does more harm than good. They are just trying to sell you their program. Static stretching, along with all the other types, is just a tool. There are cases where static stretching does more harm than good. Usually you can feel it.

I have found that pulses are all you need for posterior chain flexibility. That sharp nerve stretch feeling is actually good news to me because I know that pulses can increase ROM. 

There is also the feeling of this restriction. It’s a bit painful but not sharp. My guess is that this is a facial restriction. I haven’t found any single mode of flexibility training to help with this. I have found that on certain days, this restriction doesn’t exist. Some days I can fall into the pancake stretch. Literal months of progress overnight. This leads me to believe that it’s some sort of lifestyle/environmental cause. Possibly nutrition or hydration. 

Finally joint flexibility is another feeling. You can almost always feel it in the ankles. Static stretching seems to work for this but it has to be done consistently.
