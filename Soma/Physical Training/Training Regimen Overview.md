## Consistency
One of the most important things is consistency. A single workout does almost nothing. It’s only after you look back at 50 workouts that you see results. There are 50 thousand steps in a marathon. A single step won’t even register on a gps. The marathon gets completed by taking step after step.

Because of this, we should aim to have consistency. I have friends and students that say “what’s something I can do to lose weight?” They’re looking for an actionable item that will get them to their goals. Recently, I made a realization that the only actionable item that you can do, is to set up consistency. 

My deadlift progress was halted lately and I kept thinking “I finish work at 7 so I need to stay disciplined and workout late even though I’m tired after work.” But then I decided to move my 6pm client to 4pm. Now I finish work at 5 and have plenty of time to train. 

The action that made my deadlift increase wasn’t changing the reps scheme or adding an extra day. Moving my 6pm client to 4pm is what increased my deadlift. I just set up consistency.

So here are a few thoughts on setting up consistency:

**Time**: At 7pm, I still had time but it would cause me to rush or skip entirely. Obviously, if you have even less time, it won’t happen at all.
**Friction**: This could be anything that makes it harder to train. “The gym is too far. It’s too cold. The guy at the front desk gives me a hard time” 
**Location and setup:** The location should have what you need to train and be inviting. I realized I wasn’t consistent with my before-bed stretching. I set up a cozy corner in my room with a yoga mat on the ground and now it’s so much easier.
**Momentum:** If you haven’t started training (or haven’t started training a specific component of fitness), jumping right into it doesn’t mean you’ll stick with it right away. But if you’ve done it every day for the past year, the chances that you skip are low. Humans are creatures of habit. Sometimes breaking a habit like that is more difficult than actually doing the training. Not to mention, seeing the results of that momentum is one of the most motivating things in training.
