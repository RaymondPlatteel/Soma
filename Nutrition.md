### Current barriers

I think the biggest one is that I’ve developed a kind of PTSD with eating. I was once 205 (I’m about 190 right now). In order to get there, I had to force feed myself every day for like 2 years. I’m pretty sure during that time I never felt hunger. It worked but I think it created some kind of stress response when I even think about food. I noticed that I’ll get hungry when I’m thinking of something else but then when I think about eating, the hunger goes away. And it goes away for hours. One of the things I've been trying lately is to tell myself that I don’t have to eat until discomfort. I just have to enjoy the food. My stomachs capacity isn’t the problem so I usually end up eating enough anyway.
