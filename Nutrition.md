My current goals are to gain muscle and body fat.
My theory is that my body fat is too low to allow me enough energy during training. Also with body fat that is too low, I’m not producing the hormones I need to gain muscle optimally.

### Current barriers

I think the biggest one is that I’ve developed a kind of PTSD with eating. I was once 205 (I’m about 190 right now). In order to get there, I had to force feed myself every day for like 2 years. I’m pretty sure during that time I never felt hunger. It worked but I think it created some kind of stress response when I even think about food. I noticed that I’ll get hungry when I’m thinking of something else but then when I think about eating, the hunger goes away. And it goes away for hours. One of the things I've been trying lately is to tell myself that I don’t have to eat until discomfort. I just have to enjoy the food. My stomachs capacity isn’t the problem so I usually end up eating enough anyway.

Another is laziness. I’m so lazy to cook and I think it has to do with me imagining the grocery shopping, prep, cooking, cleaning (then eating until discomfort) all for it to taste mediocre). Who would stay consistent with that? 

I think I’m gonna try a couple things. First, the body needs only 2 things to grow muscle. Stimulating workouts, and consistent protein. Assuming my workouts do stimulate mechanical tension, then eating consistent protein throughout the day even in a calorie deficit should be enough to gain muscle. (Although the deficit would likely eat muscle faster than it’s put on).

Second is liquid calories. I’ve heard this a thousand times but I’m never consistent with it. I currently only do 1 shake per day. I think I need to do 3 per day on top of regular meals. Each shake will be around 800-1000 calories. I think 5000 calories should be very feasible. 

Now I just need to have consistency with this. 
Since time is definitely a factor, I can meal prep the dry ingredients. Actually hold on… I’m gonna leave that in there because of how stupid that is. It takes about 3 minutes to make a shake. What’s wrong with me?

But I do need to set up consistency.

**Prep**: Having all the ingredients in 1 place would help. I’m always out of soymilk. Always out of peanut butter.

**Friction:** I sometimes don’t have a blender cup. I think I should hand wash it right after I’m done and reuse it. This wouldn’t be hard.

**Flavor**: I’m afraid I’ll get sick of the same peanut butter shake if I drink 3000 calories of it every day.
